  name is Tornike, and I am a Front-End Web Developer. I have a
  passion for computers, and I thrive on exploring new ideas and
  challenges within my chosen domain. From a young age, I've been
  fascinated by computers. This curiosity led me to pursue formal
  education in Web Development, where I honed my skills and knowledge.
  Throughout my journey, I embraced every opportunity to learn, grow,
  and excel in my chosen field. As a Developer, I find joy in turning
  designs into real websites. I believe that every project is an
  opportunity to tell a unique story, and I'm committed to crafting
  meaningful experiences that leave a lasting impression. Thank you
  for visiting my portfolio. I hope you enjoy exploring my creations
  as much as I enjoyed bringing them to life. If you're interested in
  collaborating or have any questions, feel free to get in touch.
  Let's create something extraordinary together!`;
